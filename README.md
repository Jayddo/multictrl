Tired of entering commands everytime you want healbot or other addons to start or stop?  Use this to initialze your addons for alts or main and just execute with 1 command.

Using IPC now, don't require entering any alt's names.

Current commands:  Use //mc

on:  Toggles all addons that are defined under ON function such as healbot/autogeo/roller/singer etc.

off:  Toggles all addons to turn off.

d2:  Will D2 all members of current party, will rest for MP if low on MP.

fon:  Toggles healbot's follow on function, will follow to the current player executing this command.

foff:  Disable following via healbot's function.

warp:  Warp all chars using myhome addon.

omen:  Warps all chars to omen crag using myomen addon. (See MyOmen repository)

mnt:  Mount all chars using defined mount.

dis:  Dismount all chars.
